# Setting up a nix coding environement

## #1!!`*nix` bash
When using bash there is a functionality that allows you to send a process to sleep with `c-s` (Ctr+S). This will freeze the terminal when editing a file using vim and typing `c-s`.

To overcome this problem, you need to disable this functionality you need to set `stty -ixon` in your `~/.bash_profile` / `~/.bashrc` / `~/.profile`.
